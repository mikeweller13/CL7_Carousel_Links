# CL2_BootstrapCarousel

An example project based directly off of Bootstrap 3.3.6's Carousel example.

See http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples

CL7 edits: File modified for Code Lab 7 to include additional file path and link information.

Please note that the Black and White Goat Eating file is too large for Github to host, so this will be a broken link if the repository is reused.
